# AAS-connect - GraphQL API for the Asset Administration Shell

GraphQL APIs for the Industrie 4.0 Asset Administration Shell are in our opinion the easiest way to implement the Asset Administration Shell with databases, microservices, REST APIs or e.g. Static Object Storages. 

## AAS-connect schemas

In this repository you will find GraphQL schemas for the AAS in the Schema Definition Language (SDL). The neo4j and master schema is curated by FoP Consult GmbH and voted on in the community. The neo4j schema is a specification for the Neo4j database (Neo4j GraphQL Library). The master schema is a pure GQL schema according to the GraphQL Specification without directives. Further information, e.g. on the specification of the GraphQL schema for a consistent mapping to the Asset Administration Shell specifications, can be found at https://aas-connect.com/aas-connect-schema. 

Specifications for other databases can be derived from the master or neo4j schema and published here in the repository for general free use by the community.
