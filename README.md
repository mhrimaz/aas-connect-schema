# AAS-connect - GraphQL API for the Asset Administration Shell

GraphQL APIs for the Industrie 4.0 Asset Administration Shell are in our opinion the easiest way to implement the Asset Administration Shell with databases, microservices, REST APIs or e.g. Static Object Storages. 

## AAS-connect schemas

In this repository you will find GraphQL schemas for the AAS in the Schema Definition Language (SDL) provided by FoP Consult GmbH and derived schemas for other services provided by the AAS-connect community. Further information, e.g. on the specification of the GraphQL schema for a consistent mapping to the Asset Administration Shell specifications, can be found at https://aas-connect.com/ressourcen. 

The neo4j and master schema is curated by FoP Consult GmbH and voted on in the community. The neo4j schema is a specification for the Neo4j database (Neo4j GraphQL Library). Specifications for other databases can be derived from the master or neo4j schema and published here in the repository for general free use.
