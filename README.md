# AAS-connect - The Reference GraphQL Schema for the Asset Administration Shell

GraphQL APIs for the Industrie 4.0 Asset Administration Shell (AAS) are in our opinion the easiest way to implement the Asset Administration Shell within your company's software landscape and to reduce integration efforts.  

## AAS-connect schemas for different databases

In this repository you will find different variants of the AAS-connect schema in the Schema Definition Language (SDL). The master schema and the neo4j schema are developed by FoP Consult GmbH. The master schema is a pure GQL schema according to the GraphQL Specification without directives. The neo4j schema can be implemented with the graph database Neo4j using the Neo4j GraphQL Library. For feedback please create issues in this repository. 

Specifications for other databases can be derived from the master schema and published here in the repository for general free use by the community. 

Further information, e.g. on the specification of AAS-connect for a consistent mapping to the Asset Administration Shell specifications, can be found at https://aas-connect.com/aas-connect-schema.
